# SharedMemoryIPC
This is a simple example of how to use shared memory for inter-process communication in C on Windows.

## How To Run
Need to run both the Server and Client executables. The Server will create the shared memory and the Client will read from it.
The Server will need to be run first and remain running while the Client is running.
The Server will prompt the user to close itself when on keyboard input.
